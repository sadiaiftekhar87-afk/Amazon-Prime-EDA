        "Streaming platforms like Amazon Prime Video have transformed entertainment consumption, offering thousands of movies and TV shows across genres and countries. Understanding content trends and audience preferences is essential for data-driven decision-making. This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Amazon Prime Video’s dataset to uncover insights about its content and contributors.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset includes two CSV files: titles.csv with over 9,000 titles and 15 attributes (title, type, genre, release year, IMDb and TMDB scores, runtime, production countries, and seasons for TV shows), and credits.csv with over 124,000 records of actors and directors, including their names, roles, and character names. Together, these datasets provide a detailed view of the platform’s content library.\n",
        "\n",
        "The project aims to answer key questions: Which type of content dominates? What are the most common genres and producing countries? How has content release evolved over time? Who are the most frequent actors and directors? How do IMDb ratings and popularity scores vary? Insights from this analysis help stakeholders make informed decisions on content strategy, marketing, and audience engagement.\n",
        "\n",
        "EDA begins with data exploration, checking column types, missing values, and distributions. Data cleaning handles missing values and ensures consistent formats. Hypotheses guide the analysis, such as movies being more frequent than TV shows, Drama and Comedy as dominant genres, and the US as the leading content producer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Visualizations include bar charts for content types and top genres, line charts for yearly trends, histograms for IMDb ratings, and plots for top countries and frequent actors/directors. Each plot is accompanied by remarks to interpret findings in a business context.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key insights show that movies outnumber TV shows, Drama, Comedy, and Action are the most common genres, and content production has increased significantly after 2015. IMDb ratings mostly range from 6 to 8, indicating general audience approval. The United States, India, and the UK are leading producers, while certain actors and directors frequently appear in popular titles, highlighting their influence.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this EDA provides actionable insights for Amazon Prime stakeholders. The structured workflow—from exploration and cleaning to visualization and interpretation—demonstrates a practical approach for analyzing datasets, supporting informed business decisions and strategic content planning."
